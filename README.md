## About Me

I was a dedicated network engineer with a solid foundation in networking. However, I decided to pivot my career path because the field of data is incredibly captivating, and my passion for mathematics drew me toward it. While I am now focused on becoming a data expert, I still possess strong networking skills and knowledge, allowing me to leverage a unique blend of expertise in both domains.
